/// There are several different point types.
/// - [`Normal`]: A point represented internally with Affine coordinates, with x and y coordinates (if it's not zero). These can be directly serialized or hashed.
/// - [`Jacobian`]: A non-normal represented internally in Jacobian coordinates. Usually the result of a point operation. Before being serialized or hashed, you have to normalize it.
/// - [`BasePoint`]: A normal point that has pre-computed multiplication tables like [`G`].
/// - [`EvenY`]: A normal point whose y-coordinate is known to be _even_ at compile time.
///
/// To normalize a `Point<Jacobian>` you mark it as [`Normal`]:

/// let jacobian_point = g!(scalar * G);
/// let normal_point = jacobian_point.mark::<Normal>();
/// let bytes = normal_point.to_bytes(); // we can now serialize it
